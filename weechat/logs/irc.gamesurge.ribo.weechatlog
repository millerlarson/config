2014-06-13 15:26:05	invisus_home	Wait...  whut? I though ID was the right to work state and not WA.

2014-06-13 15:26:18	invisus_home	haha
2014-06-13 15:26:21	invisus_home	We'll see.
2014-06-13 15:26:32	invisus_home	I'm going to try to talk up my F5 skillets.
2014-06-13 15:26:51	ribo	hmm maybe it's not a RTW state
2014-06-13 15:26:53	invisus_home	See if they like the size of the tmos balls.
2014-06-13 15:27:03	ribo	fo sho
2014-06-13 15:27:17	invisus_home	Yeah, I don't see WA on the list.
2014-06-13 15:27:21	invisus_home	Resign away.
2014-06-13 15:27:26	ribo	lol
2014-06-13 15:27:55	invisus_home	But the spellcheck.  zomg.
2014-06-13 15:27:58	invisus_home	So nice.
2014-06-13 15:28:08	ribo	wat
2014-06-13 15:28:13	invisus_home	weechat.
2014-06-13 15:28:15	invisus_home	Spellcheck.
2014-06-13 15:28:16	ribo	ah
2014-06-13 15:28:18	ribo	hehe
2014-06-13 15:28:37	ribo	http://www.lni.wa.gov/WorkplaceRights/ComplainDiscrim/Termination/
2014-06-13 15:28:39	ribo	hmm
2014-06-13 15:28:41	invisus_home	Hoping this new version fixes the issues I was having with the windows not refreshing correctly when changing between them.
2014-06-13 15:28:43	ribo	The law does not require a business to give a worker notice before terminating their job. Nor does the law require workers to give notice before quitting. However, the business may make payment of benefits (such as vacation pay) a condition of the worker giving notice.
2014-06-13 15:28:52	invisus_home	I kept having to /window refresh or Ctrl+l
2014-06-13 15:29:22	ribo	probably your terminal settings, is it getting all fucky and misaligned?
2014-06-13 15:29:32	ribo	terminal and/or screen/tmux
2014-06-13 15:29:33	invisus_home	Yeah, still do.  But the buffer issues might be because I'm inside tmux.  Not sure.
2014-06-13 15:29:56	ribo	well, I run it in tmux too
2014-06-13 15:30:06	invisus_home	But you're you.  Everything works for you.
2014-06-13 15:30:14	ribo	nah, I had that problem too
2014-06-13 15:30:17	invisus_home	Unless it's your internets when we're watching GoT.
2014-06-13 15:30:21	ribo	lol
2014-06-13 15:30:23	invisus_home	:P
2014-06-13 15:33:03	invisus_home	Yeah, sometimes misaligned, but often it's just extra line buffer from other window that carries over to the next.
2014-06-13 15:34:36	ribo	yeah
2014-06-13 15:35:51	invisus_home	Suggestions?
2014-06-13 15:36:02	invisus_home	I mean, this version already seems much better.
2014-06-13 15:36:03	ribo	are you using putty?
2014-06-13 15:36:06	invisus_home	Which is odd.
2014-06-13 15:36:10	invisus_home	I'm using a putty clone.
2014-06-13 15:36:11	invisus_home	Kitty.
2014-06-13 15:36:15	ribo	yeah, kitty
2014-06-13 15:37:16	ribo	what's your TERM set to?
2014-06-13 15:37:35	ribo	(within tmux)
2014-06-13 15:38:14	invisus_home	miller@vantage ~ $ echo $TERM
2014-06-13 15:38:14	invisus_home	xterm-256color
2014-06-13 15:38:28	ribo	there's your problem
2014-06-13 15:38:42	invisus_home	?
2014-06-13 15:39:07	ribo	add this line to your ~/.tmux.conf
2014-06-13 15:39:09	ribo	set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"
2014-06-13 15:39:35	ribo	and quit weechat/tmux
2014-06-13 15:39:51	invisus_home	Wait.. wtf, that -is- in my tmux conf.
2014-06-13 15:40:16	ribo	then remove it from your bashrc 
2014-06-13 15:40:56	ribo	or zshrc or w/e you use
2014-06-13 15:41:08	ribo	your actual terminal should be setting that env var
2014-06-13 15:41:22	ribo	so, tmux opens a new bash, and sets it rong
2014-06-13 15:41:25	invisus_home	rgr
2014-06-13 15:41:30	invisus_home	I'll give it a shot.
2014-06-13 15:41:32	invisus_home	brb
2014-06-13 15:41:35	--	irc: disconnected from server
2014-06-13 15:47:23	ribo	yeah, went through the same thing
2014-06-13 15:47:28	ribo	"hmm did it work...?"
2014-06-13 15:47:59	invihome	haha
2014-06-13 15:48:27	invihome	Okay, now that I've gone from screen to tmux, and from irssi to weechat...  I can get back to git.
2014-06-13 15:48:35	ribo	lol
2014-06-13 15:48:38	invihome	Only... slightly destracted.
2014-06-13 15:49:03	ribo	adderall helps you focus, doesn't make sure you choose the best thing to focus on tho :P
2014-06-13 15:49:19	invihome	For sure.
2014-06-13 15:49:33	invihome	Summer was down here trying to talk to me while I was messing with stuff.
2014-06-13 15:49:38	ribo	lol
2014-06-13 15:49:47	invihome	Got mad and left.  "I was listening to you!"
2014-06-13 15:49:52	invihome	"NO.  You weren't!"
2014-06-13 15:49:54	invihome	haha
2014-06-13 15:49:57	ribo	lol
2014-06-13 15:50:01	ribo	yeah, jenn will call me here at work
2014-06-13 15:50:28	ribo	and I'll just not hear a word
2014-06-13 15:50:36	invihome	haha
2014-06-13 15:50:37	ribo	because I'm fixed in something else
2014-06-13 15:50:55	ribo	you'll have to train summer, too
2014-06-13 15:51:11	invihome	Yeah, I already went upstairs after and had a talk.
2014-06-13 15:51:14	ribo	jenn doesn't call to ask me to pick up X from safeway anymore
2014-06-13 15:51:18	invihome	"On meths.  Need time."
2014-06-13 15:51:28	ribo	she'll text it to me tho
2014-06-13 15:51:45	invihome	haha, yeah.  I always have summer actually send it somewhere for reference later.
2014-06-13 15:51:59	invihome	But yeah, weechat is pretty nice.
2014-06-13 15:52:05	ribo	indeed
2014-06-13 15:52:10	ribo	I'd suggest the iset plugin too
2014-06-13 15:52:16	invihome	Even out of the box.
2014-06-13 15:52:24	ribo	yeah, very nice
2014-06-13 16:00:14	invihome	herm.
2014-06-13 16:00:22	invihome	iset installed and loaded... but doesn't appear to pull up menu.
2014-06-13 16:01:00	invihome	nevermind.
2014-06-13 16:01:02	invihome	I'm a dolt.
2014-06-13 16:09:44	ribo	:D
2014-06-13 16:16:55	invihome	Iset menu is live.
2014-06-13 16:18:04	invihome	I went to change the color.bg_selected and started going through them after searching for red.  I changed it and "poof"  I was changing other options as changing it made the match disappear.
2014-06-13 16:43:21	invihome	ls
2014-06-13 16:43:24	invihome	erps.
2014-06-13 16:44:40	invihome	ls
